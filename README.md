# multithread_research_practice

As I am laying the roadmap for developing a multithreaded kernel, the purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my practice and research on understanding multithreading concepts via practical exercises and projects. This repository is for practice purposes only and does not serve any "end goal" whatsoever.
